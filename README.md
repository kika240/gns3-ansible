# gns3-Ansible

This project is an attempt to create a gns3 remote server from scratch using Ansible.

For this time, the project only work on Ubuntu 20.04, the project is to add other distribution support and the code to be working on every distro by default. 

# This story of this project

I was in school learning Ansible, and we was working about how to use Ansible to make config for Cisco IOU. But my gns3 VM was not working, so instead, I try to create a new one from scratch to run it on my home lab. After a day of reverse engineering with gns3 github repo and some website I make it but it crashes after a mistake of mine... So I was like "Why not make it automatic with Ansible" and this project is born.

# Disclaimer

This is my first project to github and Ansible, if my code is not good, feel free to do a pull request :D
